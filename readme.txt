Re-writes a configuration list of hostnames to the current blog address.

== Description ==
Gives you the ability to set certain paths that are to be considered "local" and
should be automatically re-written to be the current hostname the site is
running on.

For example, you may configure mysite.local as a localpath host, and upon deploying to 
mysite.com, all mysite.local/ paths would be re-written to mysite.com.
